			<h3>About</h3>

				<h4>What is a meshnet?</h4>
				<p>A meshnet is a network in which users connect with each other, rather than being dependent on a "tree" of providers. This means that a meshnet depends on collaboration between neighbors, and anyone connected can have access.</p>
				<h4>What is "Hyperboria?"</h4>
				<p>Hyperboria, also known as <i>the meshnet</i>, is the name given to the network central to <a href="https://projectmeshnet.org/">Project Meshnet</a>. It is a meshnet with over three hundred members&mdash;and counting&mdash;spread across the world, including Maryland. It uses the open-source software <a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns">CJDNS</a> to connect its members, both through the existing Internet and via physical wireless (and wired) links. Together, we make up Hyperboria.</p>
				<p>Hyperboria is free&mdash;in every sense of the word. There is no subscription fee, and there are no restrictions on what you can say or who you talk to.</p>
				<h4>Why create an alternative?</h4>
				<p>Our objective is to create a versatile, decentralized network built on secure protocols for routing traffic over private mesh or public internetworks independent of a central supporting infrastructure.</p>
