          <p>
	    The Internet is broken. In the United States, the entire Internet infrastructure is owned by 
	    an oligarchy of corporations which charge obscene prices for some of the lowest speeds and 
	    data-caps in the developed world. Websites and advertizements go to great lengths in order to 
	    track users, and private communications are sold to bring you "personalized ads." 
	    
	    <p>
	      That's not how it should be.

		The Internet gives every person a place free from censorship and judgement. The Internet does 
		not require you to submit your age, race, sex, faith, or sexual orientation to every website 
		you visit. It does not require that you conform, and it does not require that you be silent. 
		It gives every person a voice which cannot be silenced. We are trying to build an internet where 
		that cannot be changed - an internet where you cannot be spied on, or charged huge amounts of money 
		for spotty, censored, ad-riddled connections, or where the service you pay those huge amounts of 
		money for can be shut off without warning or explanation. We are trying to create an internet in 
		which every person depends only on their neighbors, not on national or multinational corporations, for 
		their connection. 
		<p>
		  That's why we're building a meshnet.

          <!--WHAT IS A MESHNET-->
          <h4>What is a meshnet?</h4>
          <p>
            A meshnet, generally speaking, is a network of computers that are connected to each other directly, 
	    without the need for a central infrastructure, such as that which an internet service provider 
	    (Verizon, Comcast, etc.) owns. Data is passed from one computer to its neighbor, and onward until it 
	    reaches its destination. How exactly to accomplish this in a fast and secure way has been a 
	    very difficult and largely unsolved problem for many years.
	    <p>
	      Today we have Cjdns.

		Cjdns is a routing engine which is fast, stable, and secure. It is actively developed primarly 
		by Caleb James Delisle, but also by a community of volunteers, and is open source and on <a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns">GitHub</a>.
