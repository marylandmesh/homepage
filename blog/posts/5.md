# New Nodeshot Map!

### New Location

Sasha and I moved [maryland.projectmeshnet.org](https://maryland.projectmeshnet.org/) from one of our servers to a VPS hosted closer to where I am than he is. 

### New Nodeshot Map

Originally our nodeshot map was hosted on [maryland.ninux.org](http://maryland.ninux.org/), but now that we moved [maryland.projectmeshnet.org](https://maryland.projectmeshnet.org/) to the VPS we're also hosting the nodeshot map there too. You can visit it at [map.maryland.projectmeshnet.org](http://map.maryland.projectmeshnet.org/).

### Currently in progress: stats.hyperboria.net

The original intention was to have a statistics section for [maryland.projectmeshnet.org](https://maryland.projectmeshnet.org/), but once I started designing the website we decided it would be better to write it as a main location for meshlocals to send their statistics every hour, day, or however often they want to send their statistics. Currently we're still working on the back-end and API, but you can view the front-end repo [here](https://github.com/marylandmesh/stat) and the back-end repo [here](https://github.com/marylandmesh/stats-backend).
